        <h3>Workflow Overview</h3>
        <p>This workflow diagram illustrates the integration of Fitbit devices, AWS infrastructure, and a web application to collect, process, and display biometric data and stress levels. It begins with the user wearing a Fitbit Versa 3 device that records biometric data (e.g., heart rate) and generates stress prompts. The companion app on a smartphone transfers this data via the Fitbit Web API to the Fitbit Remote Server, which stores the data temporarily. The data is then processed and sent through an API Gateway to AWS Lambda functions, which store it in a DynamoDB database for analysis. On the web application side, static content and visualizations are hosted in an S3 bucket and distributed globally via CloudFront, with Route 53 handling domain routing. This setup ensures seamless data collection, processing, and visualization for users and researchers.</p>

        <h3>Fitbit</h3>
        <p>This is Fitbit. This image showcases the two interfaces of the Fitbit application used for stress monitoring. The Default Face displays key biometric metrics, such as the user's heart rate, steps taken, calories burned, and battery life, offering an overview of daily activity and health. The Prompted Face appears when the application detects a significant rise in the user's heart rate, potentially indicating stress. It presents the user with four stress level options: "No Stress," "A Little," "Moderate," and "A Lot," allowing them to self-report their stress levels in real-time. This system facilitates immediate and intuitive data collection for stress analysis.</p>

        <h3>Stress Level Distribution by Gender</h3>
        <p>This bar chart shows the average number of responses for each stress level categorized by gender (female in blue and male in orange). Stress levels range from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest). The data indicates that both males and females most frequently report stress level 1, with females responding significantly more often (140.17 vs. 100.65). As stress levels increase, the number of responses decreases dramatically, with minimal responses recorded at levels 3 and 4. This trend suggests that participants, regardless of gender, rarely perceive themselves in higher stress levels, though females are slightly more likely to report at these levels than males. The chart highlights gender differences in stress perception and reporting tendencies.</p>

    <div class="visualization">
      <img src="/StressDetection/PriorInterpolation.png" alt="Prior Interpolation" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">
      <div class="visualization-content">
        <h3>Prior Interpolation</h3>
        <p>This visualization demonstrates the interpolation method applied to heart rate (HR) data in previous work. In the Initial HR Snippet, gaps of 15 seconds between timestamps are observed, making the data irregular and unsuitable for detailed analysis. The Inserted HR Values section shows how these gaps are addressed by copying existing HR values to fill the missing timestamps at 5-second intervals. The Reprocessed Dataset highlights the final result, where data is evenly spaced in 5-second increments. While this approach ensures temporal consistency, it lacks sophistication as it simply replicates values without considering the natural trends or variability in heart rate. This could potentially introduce inaccuracies in downstream analysis.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Visualization 12 -->
    <div class="visualization">
      <img src="/StressDetection/MyInterpolation.png" alt="Heart Rate Data Interpolation" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">
      <div class="visualization-content">
        <h3>Heart Rate Data Interpolation</h3>
        <p>This visualization explains the process of handling missing heart rate (HR) data using interpolation. It shows a timeline where HR data points (measured in beats per minute) are plotted before, during, and after a gap caused by missing values.
          •	Before and After GAP: Blue dots represent recorded HR values following a consistent pattern over time.
          •	Missing Values (GAP): Red indicates the absence of HR data, disrupting the continuity of the pattern.
          •	Interpolation: A green line connects the data before and after the gap, reconstructing the missing values based on the observed trend. This method estimates the missing HR values by maintaining the natural pattern in the data.
          This approach ensures smooth transitions between known data points, preserving the integrity of the dataset and enabling more accurate analysis of HR trends over time.</p>

    <div class="visualization">
      <img src="/StressDetection/interpolation1.png" alt="Comparison of Interpolation Techniques" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">
      <div class="visualization-content">
        <h3>Comparison of Interpolation Techniques</h3>
        <p>This chart illustrates the differences between cubic-spline interpolation and linear interpolation in approximating missing data points, using a true function (red line) as a reference.
          •	True Line (Red): Represents the original, smooth curve of the function.
          •	Cubic Spline (Magenta Line): Provides a smooth and continuous curve through the data points, closely following the true function. It adjusts the slope at each interval to create a natural and accurate fit, especially effective for capturing nonlinear trends.
          •	Linear Interpolation (Blue Line with Crosses): Connects the data points with straight lines. While simpler, it fails to capture the curvature of the true function, resulting in abrupt transitions and less accurate estimations.
          The chart demonstrates that cubic-spline interpolation offers a more precise and visually consistent representation of missing values in datasets where underlying patterns are nonlinear, making it preferable for applications requiring smooth and realistic reconstructions.</p>
